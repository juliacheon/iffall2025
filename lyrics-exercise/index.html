    <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
    It's so silly of me to act like I don't need you bad
    When all, all I can think about is us since I seen you last
    I know I didn't have to walk away
    All I had to do was ask for space
    I'm telling you, be on your way
    When I told you to fall back

    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    So can you come pick up your clothes?
    I have them folded
    Meet me at the door while it's still open
    I know it's getting cold out, but it's not frozen
    So come pick up your clothes
    I have them folded

    <h2>[Post-Chorus]</h2>
    I'll let your body decide if this is good enough for you
    Already folding it for you
    Already folding up for you
    I'll let your body decide if this is good enough for you
    Already folding it for you
    Already folding up for you

    <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
    No matter what you do to switch the story up, I know I made my mark
    And I would still choose you through it all, that's the crazy part (Crazy part)
    I don't need no more empty promises, promise me that you got it
    I don't need roses, just need some flowers from my garden
    Can't you go back to how you loved on me when you started?
    I'll be here begging for ya, you should be giving me love
    All damn day 'til the day is done

    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    For you to come pick up your clothes
    I have them folded
    Meet me at the door while it's still open
    I know it's getting cold out, but it's not frozen
    So come pick up your clothes
    I have them folded
    So come pick up your clothes
    I have them folded
    Meet me at the door while it's still open
    I know it's getting cold out, but it's not frozen
    So come pick up your clothes
    I have them folded

    <h2>[Post-Chorus]</h2>
    I'll let your body decide if this is good enough for you
    Already folding it for you
    Already folding up for you
    I'll let your body decide if this is good enough for you
    Already folding it for you
    Already folding up for you
    I'll let your body decide if this is good enough for you
    Already folding it for you
    Already folding up for you
    I'll let your body decide if this is good enough for you
    Already folding it for you
    Already folding up for you
